As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.

I would propose conducting the project review meetings here, and then consider a trip without any formal work-related discussions. It might be worthwhile to gather candid feedback on whether such a trip is even desired or necessary.

In terms of the project review meetings, I believe it could be more beneficial to stimulate conversations among the various teams about what strategies are effective and which ones are not. Too often, the person presenting dominates the conversation while the others remain silent, merely waiting for their turn. The meetings might be more engaging and productive if conducted in a round table discussion format.

As for the destination, I would suggest Evergreen Valley. Engage in a round of golf or rent a speedboat and jet skis. Flying to a location often consumes too much time.",0.663631796836853

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list

Phillip,
 Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list


From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
positions, I think we still have the following issues:
We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had 
three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
be outside the scope of position consolidation.

Things left to do:
I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
drill downs.
Use the above to formulate a project plan.

Things requested thus far (no particular order):
Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
ticker.
Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
add up existing position manager rows/columns).
New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
of all curves on which the desk has a position.
Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid 
would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
appropriate positions to show for each:
Gas Daily for monthly index,
Physical gas for Nymex,
Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
Physical gas for Mid market.
Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
using official valuations.
Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility 
skew and correlations.
Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  
Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
gamma grid.
Valuation of Gas Daily options.
A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.
Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
manager.
Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, 
prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.
Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
Benchmark positions in TDS.
Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit 
and explicit position break out issues.

-- Allan.

PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for 
transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that 
point.","---------------------- Forwarded by Craig Potter/ECT on 10/09/2000

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list


From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
positions, I think we still have the following issues:
We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had 
three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
be outside the scope of position consolidation.

Things left to do:
I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
drill downs.
Use the above to formulate a project plan.

Things requested thus far (no particular order):
Inclusion of Sarah Gray physical deals into the Andrews-Stevenson position manager and deal 
ticker.
Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
add up existing position manager rows/columns).
New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
of all curves on which the desk has a position.
Ability to split the current position grid to allow 2017-05-18 positions to be 
shown directly above 1991-06-18 positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid 
would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
appropriate positions to show for each:
Johnson LLC for 1991-06-18 index,
Physical gas for Morris, Martinez and Garrett,
Physical gas for Inside Flynn-Perkins,
Physical gas for Mid market.
Ability for Andrews-Stevenson to pull valuation results based on a Andrews-Stevenson flag instead of 
using official valuations.
Position and Torres, Ford and Hunt aggregation across all gas desks.
Ability to include the Gas Price book into Andrews-Stevenson:
Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility 
skew and correlations.
Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout 1977-06-06.  
Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
gamma grid.
Valuation of Johnson LLC options.
A new position screen for options (2013-08-15 x strike x delta).  TBD.
Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
manager.
Ability to view change deal Torres, Ford and Hunt in the Andrews-Stevenson deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, 
prior deal terms, and net Torres, Ford and Hunt affect of the change.
Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the Andrews-Stevenson deal ticker.
Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
Benchmark positions in Andrews-Stevenson.
Deployment of Andrews-Stevenson in Lake Hollyside. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit 
and explicit position break out issues.

Subject: Unified Database: Challenges & Task List

Dear Robert Hughes,

Below is the challenges & task list as we proceed with outlining the 
requirements for a unified digital/physical database and data capture. Our primary focus should be the first point in Lisa Thompson's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Daniel Garcia, 
on 2017-08-24,  was insightful, the solution of creating an infinitely dynamic 
unified database screen, will be extremely challenging and time 
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on 2017-08-24, Daniel Garcia alluded to the 
difficulty in reaching consensus amongst the data analysts on the presentation of the 
unified database, so the solution was to make it so that an analyst can 
customize the database screen to their preference (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on 2026-09-17 from 3 - 5 is an effort to design a desired layout for the 
unified database screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible database presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on unified digital/physical database and data capture. 
The other challenges that have been raised will be captured as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritized as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
productive. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Best regards,
Sarah Williams

Westgate

Enclosed are demographics on the Westgate site from Investor's Alliance.
Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package
on San Marcos that you received earlier.
If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.
Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?

San Marcos
The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for
sale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per square
foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West
San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.

Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes
and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25
per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and
$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This
property will have the best location for student housing of all new
projects, just as the duplexes do now.

If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there
is a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not
yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will
know more on this question later today.

Sincerely,

George W. Richards

Liane,

 As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to 
manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  It appears that a single 
buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above 
market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades, 
offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were 
bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index 
calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated 
financial swaps for San Juan.

 We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from 
September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from 
Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage 
firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a 
trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas 
daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread 
relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:

 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater 
than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 

 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & 
Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and 
       October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that 
are dramatically different.


 I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the 
trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to 
determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are 
outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in 
establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at 
$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the 
calculation of index.

 It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to 
conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me 
anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for South Bridgeport.

Amanda Powell",South Alan Index,Southern Alan Report Update,"John Smith,

As per our conversation on October 31, 2019, I am concerned that there may have been an attempt to manipulate the Johnson & Smith Index dated August 23, 2020. A single investor entered the stock market on both March 4, 2020 and March 23, 2020, purchasing shares of Techville at prices significantly higher than the market average ($470-$480 per share), seemingly with the intention of distorting the index. At the time of these transactions, shares of Techville were available at significantly lower prices (10 to 15 dollars less), but these were ignored in favor of higher-priced trades to report into the index calculation. Furthermore, these trades are inconsistent with the associated financial swaps for Techville.

We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25, 2020 to March 23, 2021. This includes all trades from Johnson & Smith Online (Davis & Jackson), direct phone conversations with Johnson & Smith, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Horne and Sons). Please refer to the attached spreadsheet for a detailed list and summary of these trades. We have also included a summary of Techville's share prices as of December 24, 2020, to illustrate its value based on several spread relationships. The two key points from this data are as follows:

1. The high physical prices on the 26th & 23rd of March ($475, $480) are significantly higher than the high financial trades ($463.75, $466.50) on November 6, 2020.

2. The spread relationship between Techville and other points (Robinson, Jackson, and Baker) is consistent with the share prices as of January 19, 2014, and January 11, 2011. It doesn't make sense to have indexes that are dramatically different.

I understand that you review the trades submitted for outliers. Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the $470's and these trades are outliers. I wanted to provide you with some additional points of reference to assist in establishing a reasonable index. It is Johnson & Smith's belief that the trades at $470 and higher were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of the index.

Our aim is to have reliable and accurate indexes against which to conduct our financial and physical business. Please feel free to contact me anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards

STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or Kelley-Lee)
general partner.  The Diaz-Stewart owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

Humphrey, Brown and Miller LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Gonzalez and Sons would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

Subject: Project Structure

STRUCTURE:
Typically, the structure is a joint venture with a corporate (or Smith-Jones)
lead partner. The Thompson-Williams entity owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of development.

Johnson, Black and Green LOANS
The project would be initiated in the name of the joint venture and
any equipment loans, infrastructure loans and development loans would be in

all of the principals in Thompson and Sons would also personally guarantee the
loans. If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for software development, that are intended for commercialization, are
full recourse loans. If we are pursuing multi-platform software developments,
the development loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the

improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an

spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would

estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the

start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or Thomas, Reid and Carter)
general partner.  The Silva-Stevens owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

Wilson-Ramirez LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Clay LLC would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Clay LLC Builders, Thomas, Reid and Carter.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
2018-02-19 design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for 1971-09-18 of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
2004-11-10 interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% 1999-10-29 interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by Colemanmouth, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that Mathews LLC considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by Mathews LLC.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released 2010-05-30 after
completion.  Releases can be granted once 2023-06-27 and you should
expect that the release would occur 1974-01-13 after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by Ho-Jimenez as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Rush Inc will be handled by the Silva-Stevens to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The Silva-Stevens
will contract with Clay LLC Builders, Thomas, Reid and Carter to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Clay LLC, Pamela Mcgrath or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership

Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is

any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track

the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Mark Jones, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the Sullivan, Morrison and Huynh tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND Dalton-Stanley
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Jeff, 
?
Is the closing today?? After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isn't binding 
as far as I can determine.? It is  too vague and it doesn't sound like 
anything an attorney or title company  would?draft for a real estate 
closing--but, of course, I could be  wrong.? 
?
If this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is 
no point in me  following up on this?document's validity.? 
?
I will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and 
find out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can.
?
I guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable 
document or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.? 
This isn't either.? I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last 
night but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said 
this is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.? 
?
I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look at 
that but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even 
needed to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any 
need to contact me regarding the  closing.
?
I really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself 
and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't 
seem to be something required for a closing.? In  the event you do need my 
signature on something like this I would rather have  time to have it 
reviewed before I accept it.

To: ""James Black"" <James.Black@freemail.com>, ""Robert A. Smith"" <Robert.A.Smith@abccorp.com> 
Subject: Contract Review



Dear Sarah Mitchell,

I am writing to inquire about the contract review scheduled for 2021-07-03. Upon examining the current agreement, I find it lacks the necessary clarity and precision. It doesn't seem to be a document that a legal team or a contract management company would draft for a business contract review. However, I am open to the possibility that I might be mistaken.

If this review is set to proceed without this agreement, then there is no need for me to further investigate its validity.

I will need to revisit my previous contract documents, assess my current position, and handle this situation as effectively as I can.

I was anticipating a document that would serve as an annexure to a recordable document or something more specific, akin to a contract. This document doesn't meet either of those expectations. I attempted to contact our legal advisor, Mr. Robert Green, last night, but he was unavailable. I discussed this with a friend who is a criminal lawyer, and he also expressed doubts about the binding nature of this document.

I will revisit my previous transaction with Laura Davis and evaluate it. Given the ambiguity and generality of this document, I doubt that my signature is even necessary to finalize this transaction. I will be available after 12 noon should there be any need to discuss the contract review.

I certainly do not wish to delay any process or create additional work for myself. I also do not want to offend or inconvenience anyone, but this document doesn't seem to be a requirement for a contract review. If you do need my signature on a document like this, I would prefer to have it reviewed before I accept it.

Best regards,

David Thompson

 Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate 
project:

 Ownership Structure

 What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?

 What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what 
capacity(regarding ownership and 
 liabilities)?

 Who owns the land? improvements?

 Who holds the various loans?

 Is the land collateral?

 Investment
 
 What happens to initial investment?

 Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?
 
 Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?

 When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment 
schedule?

 Investment Return

 Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?

 Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits 
are distributed?

 Debt

 Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral 
is associated with each 
 loan?

 Improvement

 Construction

 Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.

 Terms of each loan?

 Uses of Funds

 How will disbursements be made?  By whom?

 What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing 
for investors?

 Reports to track expenses vs plan?

 Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?

 What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get 
paid a markup on subcontractors as a 
 general contractor and paid gain out of profits?

 Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses 
before the ultimate payout of profits?

 Design and Construction
 
 When will design be complete?

 What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?

 What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction 
planning and permitting?

 Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, 
vendors, and other professionals? 
 Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?

 Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to 
use? Names?

These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor 
in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as
much as possible from the process.

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Ginachester and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for

 The Montgomery Ltd gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at Martin Group.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Vanessamouth and Brian Oconnor.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer

The seller accepted our offer 1970-10-11 evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site

Subject: FutureTech Project Proposal-Robert Smith.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proposal for the FutureTech project in Silicon Valley
that we discussed earlier. As you can see from the proposal, this project
should yield a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over the next five years.
This is particularly appealing given the project's location in a market as robust as
Silicon Valley and we are introducing a product that is competitively priced for
this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have discovered to date in the Silicon Valley market.
The project has received the necessary permits and will only require a detailed plan. As
it is in the ""Innovation Corridor"" area designated by the Silicon Valley Authority
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
by mid-2021. Additionally, many of the current and more stringent
environmental regulations have been waived. I have estimated the infrastructure
improvement costs based on a similar project we undertook in North
Silicon Valley, which included a data center and road
expansion. Even though this project is unlikely to require road
expansion and will have less of a data center
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
The existing utility line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this utility line, such as the
adjoining office complex and a project at Martin Group.
As with most tech projects, the quality of the surrounding infrastructure
is uneven. We have included a security fence around the entire property, but may
only install it on the main entrances. Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both security and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer last evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
a standard business loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project. As we discussed in our last meeting, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the infrastructure, sell the infrastructure to the construction entity
with your profit in it. I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project. You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first. Michael Johnson knows an expert in the field in New York if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Ward, Arnold and Frey for next week delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proposal, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time. You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
555-338-1119 or 555-338-1110. My cell phone is 555-748-7495 and the fax is
555-338-1103. I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major success.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events last week. A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Silicon Valley where we are building our new office.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start next week. The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down. The city shut down the project for a day and it took
a week to get everything back on track. Then, I had to take
my wife to emergency. She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week. There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday. Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

 Here sales numbers from Reagan:

 
 

 As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The 
1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the 
units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units 
under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with 
competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals 
actually done to date.   

 Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call

Here are the production figures from James Anderson:

As you can observe, his production volumes vary across different types of machinery. The Model 1308/1308 seems to have the most data and appears most similar to the machines you are operating. At $2.7 million, my bid is higher than Anderson's for his machines that are still under production. I am finding it difficult to justify paying much more with other competitors entering the market. The price I am bidding is higher than any deals actually closed to date.

Please share your thoughts on this. I will follow up with an email and a phone call regarding the West Ricky project. I am sure that Robert Smith must have informed you that our bid was turned down for the property owned by Petersen Ltd.

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

Subject: Newburyport Project Proforma-Michael Johnson.xls

Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Newburyport project in Springfield
that we discussed earlier. As you can see from the proforma, this project
should yield an exceptional return of over 40% per year over the next three years.
This is particularly appealing considering the project is in a market as robust as
Springfield and we are introducing a product that is competitively priced for
this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have discovered to date in the Springfield market.

The project has approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As
it is in the ""Green Growth Corridor"" area designated by Springfield City Council
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
by the end of next year. Additionally, many of the current and more stringent
environmental regulations have been waived. I have estimated the site
improvement costs based on a similar development we investigated in North
Springfield, which included a water management system and road
expansion. Even though this project is not likely to require road
expansion and will have less of a water management system
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.

The Johnson-Parker utility easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite
successful with similar relationships to this utility line, such as the
adjoining residential and a project at Davies, Small and Wagner.
As with most urban projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is varied. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only install it on Newburyport and Diana Johnson streets. Gated communities are more
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.

The seller accepted our offer last night with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
a Johnson-Delgado Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project. As we discussed in West Springfield, we can also discuss

exchange expert first. Sarah Williams knows an expert in the field in Lopezville if you do not know anyone.

I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Perez and Sons next week for delivery by the end of the month.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time. You can reach me during the day and in the evening at either

another week to get everything back on track. Then last week I had to take

I was aware that Regan Lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lot
duplex project, was selling his units in the $180's,  He does have a much
lower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are due
to a) he is selling them during construction and b) they are smaller units.
We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of
the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sq
footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his
sales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell
for $203,108.
What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the
rent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own
evaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the
3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we
were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom
units along with the 3-bedroom plan.

This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as

The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As

improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the

Subject: Project Alpha Proforma-Samuel Davis.xls

Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Project Alpha in Silicon Valley
that we discussed earlier. As you can see from the proforma, this project
should yield an impressive return of over 40% per year over the next three years.
This is particularly promising considering the project is in a market as robust as
Silicon Valley and we are introducing a product that is competitively priced for
this market. This is the most promising project in terms of risk and reward that we
have discovered to date in the Silicon Valley market.

The project has received necessary zoning approval and will only require a site plan. As
it is in the ""Innovation Corridor"" area designated by Silicon Valley
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
by the end of the first quarter. Additionally, many of the current and more stringent
environmental regulations have been waived. I have estimated the site
improvement costs based on a similar project we investigated in Silicon Valley,
which included a data center and road infrastructure. Even though this property is not likely to require extensive
road infrastructure and will have less of a data center
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.

The Johnson Ltd fiber optic line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact operations significantly. Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this infrastructure, such as the
adjoining tech park and a project at Greenfield Tech Park.

As with most tech park projects, the quality of the surrounding infrastructure
is uneven. We have included a security fence around the entire property, but may
only install it on Project Alpha and Smith Tech Park. Secured tech parks are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both security and current tenant
preferences.

The seller accepted our offer last evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
a Johnson Ltd Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.

This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project. As we discussed in our meeting, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the infrastructure, sell the infrastructure to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot. I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project. You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first. Alexandra Smith knows an expert in the field in Techville if you do not know anyone.

I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Greenfield Realty for next day delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time. You can reach me during office hours and in the evening at either
555-338-1119 or 555-338-1110. My cell phone is 555-748-7495 and the fax is
555-338-1103. I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major success.

I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events last week. A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Silicon Valley where we are building a data center.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start next week. The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down. The project was shut down for a week and it took
a few days to get everything back on track. Then, I had to take
my wife to emergency. She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week. There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday. Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

 Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development

 I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were 
built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for

Phillip",,,"Johnathan Peterson,

I wanted to follow up on the Oakwood condominiums and other potential investment opportunities.

I recently came across some other townhouses for sale in the same vicinity, which were constructed by Diana Mitchell. 22 units were sold for approximately $3 million, which equates to about $136,000 per townhouse. I had a conversation with Richard Thompson, who mentioned that he has more units under construction that would be available in the $140,000 range. Are the units he is selling significantly different from yours? He mentioned some of the units are based on the 1508 floor plan. My offer of $3.5 million is nearly $159,000 per townhouse.

Regarding the prospect of investing in a new project, I remain very interested.

Do not underestimate the effects of the Internet economy on load growth.  I 
have been preaching the tremendous growth described below for the last year.  
The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the 
distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for 
power quality reasons.

The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due 
to server farms and technology companies.  There is a 100 MW server farm 
trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months 
due to distribution infrastructure issues.  Obviously, Seattle, Porltand, 
Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude 
awakening in the next 2-3 years.

Internet Data Gain Is a Major Power Drain on
                  Local Utilities 

                  ( September 05, 2000 ) 


                  In 1997, a little-known Silicon Valley company called Exodus
                  Communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in 
Tukwila. 

                       The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and 
computer servers for the
                  region's growing number of dot-coms. 

                       Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up 
construction
                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than 
a mile from its
                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several 
fiber optic backbones, the
                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and 
eventually
                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, 
Microsoft and Onvia.com. 

                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data 
centers near Seattle.
                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, 
Globix and
                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house 
the networking
                  equipment of the Internet economy. 

                       It is a big business that could have an effect on 
everything from your
                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access 
your favorite Web sites.

                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and 
server farms, are
                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent 
Valley that some
                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and 
Puget Sound
                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, 
high-security
                  facilities. 

                       ""We are talking to about half a dozen customers that 
are requesting 445
                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"" 
said Karl
                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound 
Energy. ""That is
                  the equivalent of six oil refineries."" 

                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, 
the rise of the Internet
                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their 
heads. 

                       Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington 
Utilities and
                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new 
data centers. The
                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing 
residential and business
                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations 
necessary to support
                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 
million each,
                  Karzmar said. 

                       Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to 
bring up the data center
                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. 

                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, 
businesses and schools in the
                  region, this is a new and complex issue. 

                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing 
appetite for power --
                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The 
facilities run 24 hours a
                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a 
constant revenue
                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that 
they could
                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital 
expenditures. 

                       Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will 
mean for power rates
                  in the area is still open to debate. 

                       ""These facilities are what we call extremely dense 
loads,"" said Bob Royer,
                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle 
City Light. 

                       ""The entire University of Washington, from stadium 
lights at the football
                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. 
We have data
                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 
and 50 megawatts."" 

                       With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate 
complex in Tukwila is
                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased 
the 1.35 million
                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from 
Boeing Space &
                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 
92 percent of the
                  six-building complex to seven different co-location 
companies. 

                       ""It is probably the largest data center park in the 
country,"" boasts Laurent
                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG 
Communications,
                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama 
Networks all
                  lease space in the office park. 

                       After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, 
Sabey has become an
                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under 
management or
                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole 
claims his firm is
                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in 
the country. 

                       As more people access the Internet and conduct 
bandwidth-heavy tasks
                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for 
co-location space in
                  Seattle continues to escalate. 

                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center 
space is growing at a
                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, 
causing similar
                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and 
California. 

                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location 
space, plans to nearly
                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. 
While companies
                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many 
high-tech companies
                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such 
as Exodus that
                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic 
management. 

                       ""We have 2 million square feet of space under 
construction and we plan to
                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more 
demand right now
                  than data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an account 
executive at Exodus in
                  Seattle. 

                       The booming market for co-location space has left some 
in the local utility
                  industry perplexed. 

                       ""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do 
to serve the growth,""
                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry is 
almost stunned by this, in
                  a way.""","---------------------- Forwarded by Danny Jacobs/ECT on 09/06/2000

                  Local Martin LLC 

                  ( 1982-12-25 ) 


                  In 1971-05-09, a little-known Silicon Valley company called Wilkinson and Sons opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in 
East Victoriachester. 

                       The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and 
computer servers for the

                       With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate 
complex in East Victoriachester is
                  one of the biggest data centers. Booker PLC re-purchased 
the 1.35 million
                  square-foot Intergate East facility 2004-04-08 from 
Martinez, Gomez and Spencer
                  Defense. In less than 2018-05-27, the developer has leased 
92 percent of the
                  six-building complex to seven different co-location 
companies. 

                       ""It is probably the largest data center park in the 
country,"" boasts Willie Williams, chief operating officer at Vargas and Sons. Richard Hayes, Miller PLC,
                  Stuart, Elliott and Huynh, West Cindy and Valdez-Bryan all
                  lease space in the office park. 

                       After building Richard Hayes' first East Victoriachester facility in 1971-05-09, 
Vargas and Sons has become an
                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under 
management or
                  development in North Heather, Peterville and Lisaside. Jimenez PLC 
claims his firm is
                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in 
the country. 

                       As more people access the Internet and conduct 
bandwidth-heavy tasks
                  such as listening to online music, Jimenez PLC said the need for 
co-location space in
                  North Michael continues to escalate. 

                       But it is not just North Michael. The need for data center 
space is growing at a
                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, 
causing similar
                  concerns among utilities in places such as East Michael and 
Tamaraview. 

                       Richard Hayes, one of the largest providers of co-location 
space, plans to nearly
                  double the amount of space it has by 2000-03-12. 
While companies
                  such as Barnett LLC run their own server farms, many 
high-tech companies
                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such 
as Richard Hayes that
                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic 
management. 

                       ""We have 2 million square feet of space under 
construction and we plan to
                  double our size in 1983-10-29 , yet there is more 
demand right now
                  than data center space,"" said Jacqueline Reed, an account 
executive at Richard Hayes in
                  North Michael. 

                       The booming market for co-location space has left some 
in the local utility
                  industry perplexed. 

                       ""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do 
to serve the growth,""
                  said North Michael City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry is

Do not underestimate the effects of the digital economy on data growth.  I 
have been emphasizing the significant growth described below for 2019-07-13.  
The current infrastructure simply cannot handle these data volumes at the 
distribution level and ultimately distributed storage will be required for 
data quality reasons.

East Tanyafort West Frankside, South Heatherland has experienced 300+ TB of data growth 1991-03-24 due 
to server farms and technology companies.  There is a 100 TB server farm 
trying to connect to Ricky Johnson as we speak and they cannot deliver for 2018-05-27 
due to distribution infrastructure issues.  Obviously, North Michael, Youngport, 
Smithview, Lisaside, South Sherri and New Joseph in your markets are in for a rude 
awakening in the next 1971-05-09-03-01.

Data Surge Is a Major Storage Drain on
                  Local Martin LLC 

                  ( 1982-12-25 ) 


                  In 1971-05-09, a little-known Silicon Valley company called Wilkinson and Sons opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in 
East Victoriachester. 

                       The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and 
computer servers for the
                  region's growing number of tech companies. 

                       Fast-forward to 1984-03-07. Richard Hayes is now wrapping up 
construction
                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than 
a mile from its
                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several 
fiber optic backbones, the
                  Richard Hayes facility will store enough data for a small town and 
eventually
                  house servers for firms such as Avenue A, 
Cox, Sanchez and Stewart and Holt-Baker. 

                       Richard Hayes is not the only company building massive data 
centers near North Michael.
                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like Stewart and Sons, 
Globix and
                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house 
the networking
                  equipment of the digital economy. 

                       It is a big business that could have an effect on 
everything from your
                  2019-01-16 internet bill to the ease with which you access 
your favorite Web sites.

                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and 
server farms, are
                  sprouting at such a furious pace in East Victoriachester and the Kent 
Valley that some
                  have expressed concern over whether North Michael City Light and 
Barrett-Atkins can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, 
high-security
                  facilities. 

                       ""We are talking to about half a dozen customers that 
are requesting 445
                  terabytes of data in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"" 
said Norma ClarkDesiree Clayton, manager of revenue requirements for Cannon, Ramsey and Garcia. ""That is
                  the equivalent of six oil refineries."" 

                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, 
the rise of the Internet
                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their 
heads. 

                       Reyes-Simpson 2017-04-17 asked the East Meganmouth 
Martin LLC and
                  Taylor, Duncan and Newton to accept a tariff on the new 
data centers. The
                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing 
residential and business
                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations 
necessary to support
                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 
million each,
                  Desiree Clayton said. 

                       Not to be left behind, North Michael City Light plans to 
bring up the data center
                  issue on 1980-08-21 at the North Michael City Council meeting. 

                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, 
businesses and schools in the
                  region, this is a new and complex issue. 

                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing 
appetite for power --
                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The 
facilities run 24 hours a
                  day, 2000-04-13 a week, and therefore could become a 
constant revenue
                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that 
they could
                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital 
expenditures. 

                       Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will 
mean for power rates
                  in the area is still open to debate. 

                       ""These facilities are what we call extremely dense 
loads,"" said Jeff Hicks,
                  director of communications and public affairs at North Michael 
City Light. 

                       ""The entire University of East Meganmouth, from stadium 
lights at the football
                  game to Brown Inc, averages 31 terabytes per day. 
We have data
                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40

                  one of the biggest data centers. Booker PLC re-purchased

Hi Phillip.  We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team
Selection information.

Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form
we sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the
database directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the
ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still
require additional information.

We need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot
email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
we send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have
each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.

So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
to instead, provide the needed information via email.

Thank you for your assistance Phillip.

 The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  See if you can add 
these modifications:

 1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It 
should read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below.

 2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed.  
=e6-g6.

 3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width 
is too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside the

 Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:

  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
  
  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 

   Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


 That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think 
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.

 Current price 37
 Nat. Gas 34
 Crude  10

 Total  81

 
 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this 
looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, 
Tosco, and SLB?

Thank you,

Thank you for the analytical report on the Patterson-Miller merger. Here are my observations:

Daily Product Sales: 916,000 units x 16th July 2007 = 334,340,000 units since 2nd January 1973

Estimated Product Prices: $985,721,000/334,340,000 = $2.95/unit

The actual product prices are around $1.00/unit higher and increasing.

With more accurate product prices from the Harrison-Turner analysis:
(334,340,000 units X $1/unit)/116,897,000 shares outstanding = $2.86 additional EPS X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share

This is a rough valuation based on product prices. I believe the prices of raw materials are undervalued by approximately $10/share.

Current price: 37
Product: 34
Raw Materials: 10

Total: 20th June 2011

Could you please review these figures and provide a counter-argument? From my perspective, this seems like the most profitable stock to own. Also, could you send me a report on the Anderson, Davis, and Thompson merger, Jane Smith, and Baxter International?

Thank you,

Phillip,
We have been working on different software modules since 2019-06-26 and having to
listen to different team members about what Stephen Harris is saying. Should I be concerned?
Bugs seem to be invading our code. You got my other emails, Wayne is working
on the dashboard that I need up so that I can let the team know about
what is going on. Gave Team #25 a notice about having too many members working on
that module and that problem has been resolved. Also, I have a team member in Team #29 that
is complaining about Team #28 using inappropriate language in the chat. I sent Team #28 a code of conduct violation notice, we
will see how that goes.
                                                  Talk to you tomorrow,

   Peter,
        2021-08-03 was quite a busy day as David Spencer, our lead engineer, had to attend a regulatory compliance meeting, and I had to accompany him. This took a significant chunk out of my workday. If you get a chance, could you please remind him to address the issue with his workstation? This way, he can manage his tasks more efficiently. On 2021-06-03, Matthew Thompson, our project manager, will be visiting. I have to sign off now, but I will email you tomorrow.
